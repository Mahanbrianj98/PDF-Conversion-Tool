Ideas to improve project.
- Dynamic User Inputs:- Add user-configurable options for number patterns, crop ratios, or OCR language via a pop-up window or command-line arguments.

- Error Recovery:- Skip problematic pages instead of halting the process and log skipped pages for later review.

- Image Preprocessing for OCR:- Improve OCR accuracy with preprocessing steps:- Grayscale conversion
- Thresholding (binarization)
- Noise removal

- Use OpenCV or PIL for these enhancements.

- Parallelize OCR for Images:- Process multiple images from a single PDF page concurrently to optimize performance.

- Detailed Reporting:- Generate a summary report at the end, detailing:- Total pages processed
- Successfully processed pages
- Skipped pages (with logged reasons).


- Enhanced Progress Tracking:- Show percentage completion or estimated time remaining on the progress bar for better feedback.

- Expand File Compatibility:- Extend support to other file formats such as DOCX, PPTX, or various image formats.

- Output Folder Organization:- Group output files into subdirectories based on criteria (e.g., page numbers or series of numbers).

- Code Modularization:- Refactor the script into reusable modules or classes for better readability, debugging, and scalability.

- Cross-Platform Compatibility:- Ensure compatibility across operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) by adapting path handling and dependencies.

- Multithreading for Large PDFs:- Test the multithreading implementation for large PDF files to ensure proper thread synchronization and memory efficiency.
