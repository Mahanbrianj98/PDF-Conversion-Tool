Ideas to improve project.
- Dynamic User Inputs:- Add user-configurable options for number patterns, crop ratios, or OCR language via a pop-up window or command-line arguments.

- Error Recovery:- Skip problematic pages instead of halting the process and log skipped pages for later review.

- Image Preprocessing for OCR:- Improve OCR accuracy with preprocessing steps:- Grayscale conversion
- Thresholding (binarization)
- Noise removal

- Use OpenCV or PIL for these enhancements.

- Parallelize OCR for Images:- Process multiple images from a single PDF page concurrently to optimize performance.

- Detailed Reporting:- Generate a summary report at the end, detailing:- Total pages processed
- Successfully processed pages
- Skipped pages (with logged reasons).


- Enhanced Progress Tracking:- Show percentage completion or estimated time remaining on the progress bar for better feedback.

- Expand File Compatibility:- Extend support to other file formats such as DOCX, PPTX, or various image formats.

- Output Folder Organization:- Group output files into subdirectories based on criteria (e.g., page numbers or series of numbers).

- Code Modularization:- Refactor the script into reusable modules or classes for better readability, debugging, and scalability.

- Cross-Platform Compatibility:- Ensure compatibility across operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) by adapting path handling and dependencies.

- Multithreading for Large PDFs:
  - Test the multithreading implementation for large PDF files to ensure proper thread synchronization and memory efficiency.

- Error alerts:
  - Display detailed error messages for specific failures like file read/write errors or missing files, 
  - Add error alert pop-ups using tkinter's messagebox.

- GPU Utilization:
  - Replace some image processing tasks with OpenCV and enable GPU acceleration.
  - Use libraries like cuDNN and CUDA (if supported on the system) for Tesseract OCR or image enhancement.

- Interactive Crop Preview:
  - Use a GUI library like tkinter or PyQt to display the page/image.
  - Let users manually adjust the crop region with draggable boxes before applying changes.
  - Preview the cropped area and allow user confirmation

Batch Processing with Specified Output Folders:
  - Allow users to select a folder containing multiple PDF files.
  - For each PDF, prompt users to specify a unique output folder.
  - Use tkinter's askdirectory() within a loop to handle folder selection for each file

Develop a Python program that allows a user to visually select an area of a sample PDF page using a graphical user interface. 
The selected area will act as a pattern for recognizing pages containing similar elements (e.g., a company logo or header) across the PDF file. 
Pages will be grouped by detected patterns and saved into separate folders, 
with multithreading for performance and error alerts for misclassified pages.
